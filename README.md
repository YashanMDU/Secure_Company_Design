# Secure Company Design

This project demonstrates a comprehensive campus network infrastructure designed and implemented using Cisco Packet Tracer, following a hierarchical architecture that ensures scalability, redundancy, and security for enterprise environments.

## Key Features

- **Hierarchical Design** – Core Layer, Distribution Layer, and Access Layer
- **ISP Connection** – Dual ISP links for redundancy
- **WLC Integration** – Wireless LAN Controller used to manage and distribute WLANs
- **VLAN & Inter-VLAN Routing** – Implemented for each building
- **EtherChannel** – Configured between two Layer 3 switches for link aggregation
- **VoIP** – Voice connectivity established between departments
- **STP & BPDU Guard** – Spanning Tree Protocol features for loop prevention and port protection
- **Subnetting** – Efficient IP address planning and implementation
- **Security Configurations** – Password protection, Port Security, and Access Control Lists (ACLs)
- **IP Assignment & Security** – DHCP with DHCP Snooping for safe IP allocation
- **Routing** – Dynamic routing configured using OSPF
